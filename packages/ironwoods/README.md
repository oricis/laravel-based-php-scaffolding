## How to load?

There are two ways to add the package to your project:
with *Composer* or with *requires*.

To ***load with Composer*** including the "ironwoods" contents in the
"packages" directory and edit your "composer.json":

 - On the "autoload" / "psr-4" section add:
    "Ironwoods\\": "packages/ironwoods/",
    "Ironwoods\\Exceptions\\": "packages/ironwoods/Exceptions/src/"
 - On the: "autoload" / "files" section add:
    "packages/ironwoods/Helpers/loader.php"

Example:

    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "App\\": "app/",
            "Ironwoods\\": "packages/ironwoods/",
            "Ironwoods\\Exceptions\\": "packages/ironwoods/Exceptions/src/"
        },
        "files": [
            "app/Helpers/loader.php",
            "packages/ironwoods/Helpers/loader.php"
        ]
    },

To ***load without Composer*** add the next require on the top of your entry
file (assuming that the entry file is "public/index.php"):
